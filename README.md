# svm_workbook
It is a workbook on building a basic svm classifier from scratch using python. The workbook also consists of how to implement svm using scikit-learn library.

# August 1, 2020
I have learnt deeper about SVM from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition by Aurélien Géron.

# August 2, 2020
I have referred to an towardsdatascience blog for the implemtation of svm from scratch.
The blog can be found at the below link-

I have written the implementation code in svm.ipynb file.

# August 4, 2020
I have updated the svm.ipynb file adding the sklearn implementation.
